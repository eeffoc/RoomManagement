# RoomManagement
Software Engineering Group A (Thursday) coursework 2016 - Room Management and Booking Software

This system is designed to allow a set of rooms to be added to a system of users and allow them to make and manage their bookings. The system consists of a MySQL database which is queried by the client side application to manage the bookings. Admin capabilities are accessible by users marked on the system as admin, they have additional functionality such as the ability to add/remove rooms and users to the database.

To access the system please log in using username: "admin" password: "password".    This will allow you to access an account with admin authorization, with this you can create new admin users with specific user ID's and passwords.  The initial admin user can then be deleted or password changed to protect the system when it is ready to be used.

The system is populated with approx 100 users, rooms and bookings for demonstration purposes.
