# **RoomManagement**
### **Software Engineering Group A (Thursday) coursework 2016 - Room Management and Booking Software**

#### Introduction:
This system is designed to allow the management of room bookings from users in reference to a group of rooms designated by administrative users.

The system is designed to allow a set of rooms to be added to a system of users and allow them to create or manage their room bookings. The system consists of a MySQL database to be hosted on a server which is queried by the client side application to manage the bookings. Additional Admin capabilities are accessible by users marked on the system as admin, they have additional functionality such as the ability to add/remove rooms and users to the database.


#### Accessing the system

**To access the system please log in using:**

**Username:   "admin"
Password:   "password"**  

This will allow you to access an account with admin authorization, with this you can create new admin users with specific user ID's and passwords.  The initial admin user can then be deleted or change the password to protect the system when it is ready to be deployed.

#### Test Data for the system
The system can be populated with approx. 100 users, rooms and bookings for demonstration and testing purposes by using the generated data available in the "Database initiation SQL" file. This data can be added to the desired server that will be used to host the SQL Database when hosting the application.

This data can then be used to test the operation and functionality of the system before it is deployed to the users, this will ensure the system and its capabilities are best suited for the users.
